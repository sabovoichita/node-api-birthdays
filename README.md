DB (MySQL) as storage
Recipes are stored in MySQL

configure user & pass for MySQL connection routes/recipes-db.js
create a database named recipes
run http://localhost:3000/recipes/install
now you can run all CRUD operations
the same as for JSON but change the URL from "recipes-json" -> "recipes"
TODOs
in case port is used...

give hints...
and change the port if not possible.
Add port config.
